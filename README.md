My First Git-hub Contribution
I enjoy programming in my spare time and am going to be starting to utilise new open source microsoft technologies, .net CORE, open.xamarin.com and hope to utilise open source projects in my organisation and contribute exmaples and experiences back onto github.

!!! Github and StackOverFlow Rule !!!
